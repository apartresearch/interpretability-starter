# Interpretability starter

Interpretability research is an exciting and growing field of machine learning. If we are able to understand what happens within neural networks in diverse domains, we can see **why** the network gives us specific outputs and detect deception, understand choices, and change how they work.

# Starter projects

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Simple templates & tools

### [Activation Atlas](https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/) [tool]

The [Activation Atlas article](https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/) has a lot of figures where each has a Google Colab associated with them. Click on the "Try in a notebook". An example is [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/lucid/blob/master/notebooks/activation-atlas/activation-atlas-simple.ipynb) that shows a simple activation atlas.

Additionally, they have [this tool](https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/app.html) to explore to which sorts of images neurons activate the most to.

### [EasyTransformer](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/Easy-Transformer/) [code]

A library for mechanistic interpretability called EasyTransformer (still in beta and has bugs, but it's functional enough to be useful!):¬†<https://github.com/neelnanda-io/Easy-Transformer/>

#### [Demo notebook of EasyTransformer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mL4KlTG7Y8DmmyIlE26VjZ0mofdCYVW6)

A demo notebook of how to use Easy Transformer to explore a mysterious phenomena, looking at how language models know to answer "John and Mary went to the shops, then John gave a drink to" with Mary rather than John:¬†<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mL4KlTG7Y8DmmyIlE26VjZ0mofdCYVW6>

### [Converting Neural Networks to graphs](https://github.com/apartresearch/interpretability/tree/main/graphs) [code]

This repository can be used to transform a linear neural network into a graph where each neuron is a node and the weights of the directional connections are decided by the actual weights and biases.

You can expand this project by using the graph visualization on the activation for specific inputs and change the conversion from weights into activations or you can try to adapt it to convolutional neural networks. **Check out the code below**.

### Reviewing explainability tools

There are a few tools that use interpretability to create understandable explanations of why they give the output they give. [This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_OfQuqEZsd6fC_cLGu43S58eUo_bIAmB?usp=sharing) provides a small intro to the most relevant libraries:

- [ELI5](https://pypi.org/project/eli5/): ELI5 is a Python package which helps to debug machine learning classifiers and explain their predictions. It implements a few different analysis frameworks that work with a lot of different ML libraries. It is the most complete tool for explainability.

- [LIME](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html): Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations. The [TextExplainer library](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/black-box-text-classifiers.html) does a good job of using LIME on language models. Check out Christoph Molnar's introduction [here](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html).

### [Redwood Research's interpretability on Transformers](http://interp-tools.redwoodresearch.org/) [tool]

Redwood Research has created a [wonderful tool](http://interp-tools.redwoodresearch.org/) that can be used to do research into how language models understand text. The ["How to use" document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ECwTXrgTqgiMN24L7IantJTaFpyJM2LxXXGq50meFKc/edit) and [their instruction videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwvzObS_ayucGlYIJCyagdA) are very good introductions and we recommend reading/watching them since the interface can be a bit daunting otherwise.

Watch this video as an intro:
